### XREngine Project - Digital Being

## Digital Being Project

The Digital Beings Project is a collaboration between XR Foundation and Super Reality. The goal of this pilot is to demonstrate, without concern for scalability, that intelligent agents can be mentored by users and serve as viable knowledge experts to scale knowledge beyond the capabilities of a traditional teacher.

## About

Digital Being is a software that connects AI agents with a range of IM and VR software, making their deployment easier. You pick a bot, fill the account data and you're able to converse with a bot using SMS, Twitter or other social media.

Made in partnership with SuperReality, a free open source teaching platform for everyone.

Digital Being is written in Typescript and Python. Typescript is used for the clients of most known social networks, as well as XR-Engine, a 3D metaverse architecture. A layer that connects the AI agents is called the server, and is written in Python.
